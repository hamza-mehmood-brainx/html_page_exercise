                <p>Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Systems for macOS and
                    Windows. Photoshop was created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll. Since then, it has become the de
                    facto industry standard in raster graphics editing, such that the word "photoshop" has become a verb
                    as in "to Photoshop an image," "photoshopping" and "photoshop contest", though Adobe discourages
                    such use.
